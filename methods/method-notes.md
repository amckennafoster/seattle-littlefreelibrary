## Creating pie charts of genre classifications

Want to compare proportions of genres if all the LFLs were the same size, i.e. 1 cubic foot. So raw counts should be summed by LFL and divided by the volume of that LFL giving a count per 1 cubic foot.
Otherwise, a large library filled with one genre could unduly influence the chart. If five LFLs had 90% history but there was one really big LFL full of children's books that made the overall percentage of history only 40%, visiting a random LFL of those six would most likely not show you what you expect (children's books).
Standardizing by volume would make this more accurate.
