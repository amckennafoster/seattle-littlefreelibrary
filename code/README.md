# README code and data

To reproduce the analysis for this project you need to run three jupyter notebooks. 

Run them in this order: census, bookData, publicLibraryComparison. Cluster analysis was done in R and that file is in bookData/cluster.

The publicLibraryComparison creates a very large data file and the cleaned up version with data only relevant to this study is included in the folder.

Code used for this project

- bookData: All the data and code to analyze the contents of LFLs
- census: All the data and code to retrieve and analyze census data
- publicLibraryComparison: All the data and code to retrieve and analyze public library information
