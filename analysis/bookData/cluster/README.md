# README - Bray Curtis

While Python was used for most analysis, cluster analysis was easier in R. This analysis clusters LFLs based on the number of books per volume by genre.

- bray-curtis-clustering.R: R file that performs the clustering analysis
- cat-density-collection.csv: The 'density' of books in each genre in each LFL. This file is created in the LFL-Analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook
